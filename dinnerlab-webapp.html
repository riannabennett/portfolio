                <h4>Dinner Lab Web Application</h4>
                <p><i>Role: Lead Product & Visual Designer, Service Design</i></p>
                <br>
                <h6>Dinner Lab invites members to try new recipes from rotating chefs across the country and give feedback. The dinners are held in unique spaces that exist for only 24 hours and feature chefs from some of the world's best restaurants. With over 70,000 members and 2,000 chefs in 31 cities across the country, Dinner Lab is the nation’s largest supper club. Dinner Lab is more than your typical night out. It is an event experience company, with a logistical and technology backbone that has disrupted the industry, changing the way people think about eating out.  As the lead visual and product designer, I helped completely rethink a clunky web app and build out a brand new responsive, intuitive e-commerce platform.

                    <h5>Intro</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>As an early employee of Dinner Lab, I was the lead product and visual designer from the initial conception and strategy phase through implementation (and, of course, constant iteration!). After closing our first round of funding, I was tasked with aligning various internal team priorities for the new product and design a completely new UI/UX that could accommodate our quickly increasing membership numbers and additional admin and user tools that were not currently supported. Our platform had to provide functionality for members, chefs, employees, and partners including Google, Live Nation, and American Express.  Ultimately, I was tasked with creating a more unified online and offline brand, making interacting with the brand as accessible, frictionless, and beautiful as possible.

                    <h5>The Problem</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>After undergoing expansive geographic and membership growth, Dinner Lab needed to rethink the existing web platform to facilitate seamless experiences for event discovery and purchasing. Both user needs and new business initiatives were deeply studied to accommodate the best solution for all groups. The business development team wanted to showcase our private events, accommodate direct venue and chef booking, track members in order to better cater to their wants and needs, and view live event data. Our members wanted to ability to quickly view and share upcoming events, browse their past events, easily update profile data and add relevant guest information. Finally our guest chefs and contract staff, who are notoriously tough to communicate with online, needed the ability upload menu concepts, revise and edit menus, chat with our curation team, and review event feedback.
</p>

                    <h5>Research</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>During the initial phases of the project, we worked closely with the business development team, culinary operations team, as well as Dinner Lab members to inform features and issues on the current site. The initial Dinner Lab site was developed piecemeal and was not based on common user flows. The interface was complex and not intuitive, preventing new members from joining and making ticket purchasing difficult for existing members.  The admin functionality on the site was incredibly cumbersome and prevented efficiency within the team.  It was very time consuming to access important feedback from past events - the team relied heavily on google docs for organizing important data. </p><br>
                    <p>
                    Faced with these challenges, we spend considerable time testing our ideas with usability tests, surveys, brainstorming and feedback sessions and A/B testing. Our operations team were the people with boots on the ground in each city. They understand the logistics. Member relations knew the intricacies of out members, providing countless insights into how our users interact with the site. This allowed us to pinpoint and prioritize features to develop.  By constantly questioning our assumptions and responding to feedback we refined, altered and simplified the product.

                    <h5>Journey Mapping</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>To quickly highlight potential problems a user may meet, we conducted simply user journey maps. In this example, the user is attempting to create an account and purchase tickets to an event. This exercise was repeated for different user types to be sure we accounted for different user needs and stories.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>After establishing clear journey maps, more detailed user flows were documented in Lucid Charts. These flows became the guiding document for the design and development teams during the remainder of the project. </p>

                    <h5>Sketches and Wireframes</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>I began the design process with quick and iterative hand sketching to see how the app would function and determine which elements would appear on each screen. This process was refined with input from the development teams and other stakeholders.  I then produced low fidelity wireframes to prototype and simplify the concept.

                    <p>
                    After the site architecture, user flows, and wireframes were solidified, I worked to build out the look and feel of visual components that would drive the final site design of all views.  I created a responsive and systematic Style Guide in order improves workflow and ensures consistent, clean UI across the digital experience.  This also included the design of a comprehensive icon set that fit with he branding and interface that would be used by all internal teams to create branded collateral. </p>

                    <p>
                    As a tech centered dining company, it was important for us to understand the physical, emotional, and social contexts in which people engage with our product. It was a high priority for Dinner Lab to unify our digital and physical interactions, addressing the comprehensive customer journey across digital and physical as one, since the largest interaction that members have with our brand happens offline. Our end-to-end user experience spans multiple modes and locations, and asks customers to engage in both digital and physical interactions. The journey forms the entire experience, from the moment the customers first engages with the brand online, to when they purchase tickets to their first event, to whether or not they spread the word to friends. We knew that establishing a data driven approach to event curation and experience was as important as prioritizing our simple customer service.</p>

                    <h5>Results for Dinner Lab</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ultimately, this process led to us improving the user tools for adding guest information, diner allergies, multi city event browsing, new event notification, and seamless integration with Sales Force. These features not only allowed for a better member experience online, but streamlined our internal workflow allowing us to focus on improving the event experience and other business verticals. Since launching the site in June 2014, we have increased our membership from 15,000 to 70,000 members and expanded into 15 additional markets. Increased understanding of our event statistics has helped our operations team improve and streamline their processes. Sales for private events and large partnerships have also greatly increased.

                    <h5>My Role</h5>
                    <br><p>
                    I was the sole designer with Dinner Lab, working as lead on branding, product design, and visual design for all initiatives. As an early stage startup, I was regularly thrown into project that I did not have experience working with. This allowed me to learn as I went, taking courses on front end development, teaching myself the latest design and prototyping tools, and staying up to date with the latest design thinking and strategy. As lead designer on the project, I was able to sweat all the small details and work closely with our developers to be sure things were implemented correctly.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>I've helped completely rethink a clunky web app and build out a brand new responsive, intuitive e-commerce platform. This redesign focused on: streamlining the overall information architecture, simplifying the flows for ticket purchasing and chef menu submission, admin tools, member profile functionality, and optimizing the design and content of landing pages across the site.
