                <br>
                <h6>As a passion project, I worked with a team of 2 friends to construct a unique float to roll in Mardi Gras parades. With backgrounds in architecture and digital design, we took the design of the wheel very seriously and continuously iterated to create a highly functional and visually captivating object to draw the attention of thousands of Mardi Gras revelers.</h6>

                    <br>
                    <p>The original concept for this project was developed for a design competition at Tulane School of Architecture.  The design was driven by a reinterpretation of the project prompt - “provide a mobile platform for soapbox expression”. The team centered the approach around the individuals ability to both move the object and occupy for expression. Mobility was the driving design parameter behind the form, lending to the obvious wheel form. The prefect circle was designed and fabricated to be lightweight enough for a single user to transport and sturdy enough for multiple users to occupy.</p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                    This concept was reborn during Mardi Gras to partake in several walking parades.  While Mardi Gras has a storied tradition of hand crafted, artistic floats, the large parades boast massive floats that are pulled by tractors.  In response to this explosion of massive commercial floats, many small rogue parades have popped up.  These parades employ the same amount of craft and ingenuity but require floats to be hand made and man powered.  These constraints led our three person team to reconfigure an old design project to be a part of a new Mardis Gras tradition.  We increased the depth of the wheel, refined the construction technique, and selected more durable materials to be sure the wheel could safely navigate the crowds of Mardi Gras and reliably make it through the miles of parade route.

                    <h5>Result</h5>
                    <br>
                    <p>The "Human Hamster Wheel", as it was affectionately named, was fabricated from two continuous 3/4” plywood ribs, connected by radial, serial sectioned vertebrate. The product was designed using Rhino 3D modeling software and AutoCAD.  Our team was able to iterate and refine the project through the use of laser cut prototypes.  Once the design was finalized, the filed were sent to a local CNC mill for cutting.  The precision of the CNC cuts allowed the leading edges of the wheel to roll with relative ease and construction time to be reduced.  The wheel was made in quarters so it could fit on a standard CNC bed and to allow it to be disassembled and transported in an SUV.  The inside rings of the wheel were wrapped with programmable LED strip lights that were sequenced to fit the mood of the parade and could be controlled wirelessly. The wheel rolled in 3 parades – The Intergalactic Krewe of Chewbacchus, Muses, and Box of Wine – and was featured on multiple news outlets.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>This project provided significant insight into the design and construction process - from early design schematics to fabrication.  As a primarily digital designer, it was fun to break our of the computer and cross into physical product design.  This passion project utilized my skill set that I honed in architecture school as well as my digital design experiences.</p>

                    This project was featured on NOLA.com and rolled in 3 parades during the 2016 Carnival Season.
